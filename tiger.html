                 <h3>TIGERS</h3>
                 <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species, known for its orange coat with black stripes and white underparts. A solitary and powerful predator, it mainly hunts large animals like deer and wild boar.</p>
                 <p>Once widespread across Asia, tigers now occupy only a fraction of their historic range due to habitat loss, poaching, and human conflict. Today, they are found in isolated regions of South and Southeast Asia, and the Russian Far East.</p>
                 <p>There are several subspecies, including the Bengal, Siberian, and Sumatran tigers, with some critically endangered. Listed as Endangered by the IUCN, tigers are the focus of global conservation efforts to protect their habitats and prevent extinction.</p>
                 <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                 <p>You will find the tigers next to the lions</p>
